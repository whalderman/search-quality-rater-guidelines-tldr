# Specificity of Queries and Landing Pages

Some queries are very general and some queries are specific. Here are some examples that compare levels of specificity of English (US) queries:

Query|More Specific Query|Even More Specific Query
---|---|---
`chair`|`dining room chair`|`ikea "henriksdal" highback upholstered chair`
`library`|`harvard library`|`harvard anthropology library`
`interview questions`|`interview questions for teachers`|`practice interview questions used for teach for america`
`restaurants`|`chinese restaurants`|`takeout chinese restaurants in downtown Austin`
`coffee shops`|`starbucks`|`red rock coffee mountain view`

Results for specific queries are easier to rate on the Needs Met scale because we know more about what the user is looking for. Giving a Needs Met rating for results for general queries can be difficult. As always, your rating is based on how helpful the result is for the query, not the specificity fit.

When the query is a broad category, such as `cafes` `restaurants` `hotels` `books` `tourist attractions in paris` etc., popular and prominent examples may be considered very helpful. Please do web research to help you understand what is popular and prominent in different locations.
