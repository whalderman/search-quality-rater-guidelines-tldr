# Rating Using the Needs Met Scale

There are many different kinds of queries and results, but the process of rating is the same: **Needs Met rating tasks ask you to focus on mobile user needs and think about how helpful and satisfying the result is for the mobile users.**

This is what the Needs Met rating slider looks like:

![The Needs Met Rating scale](../images/needs-met-scale.jpg)

## Needs Met Ratings

- **Fully Meets (FullyM)**  
A special rating category, which only applies to certain queries and results. All or almost all mobile users would be immediately and fully satisfied by the result and would not need to view other results to satisfy their need.
- **Highly Meets (HM)**  
Very helpful for many or most mobile users. Some users may wish to see additional results.
- **Moderately Meets (MM)**  
Helpful for many users OR very helpful for some mobile users. Some or many users may wish to see additional results.
- **Slightly Meets (SM)**  
Helpful for fewer mobile users. There is a connection between the query and the result, but not a strong or satisfying connection. Many or most users would wish to see additional results.
- **Fails to Meet (FailsM)**  
Completely fails to meet the needs of the mobile users. All or almost all users would wish to see additional results.

Please note that you may assign **in-between** ratings. Use in-between ratings if you think the rating of a result falls between two labels. You can either drag the slider or click on the point that you want the slider to land on.

## Rating Result Blocks: Block Content and Landing Pages

For Needs Met rating, you will assign a rating to each result. Each result includes the content inside the result block and landing pages associated with the result.

Which part of the result do you rate? It depends on both the query and the result block:

### Result Block Types

#### Special Content Result Block (SCRB)

<div class="note">

Note: Assume that interactive result blocks function as intended. Try to interact with the result block as some links, buttons, or other features in your rating task may work.

</div>

**What to Rate:** The content inside this type of block should always play a large role in your rating. In addition, think about whether a user would click on the link(s) if available, in order to satisfy their user need.  

- If most users would not click, rate the Special Content Result Block based on the block content alone.
- If some or many users would click, you may consider the helpfulness of the landing page(s) in addition to the content in the block. In this case, both need to be helpful to justify a high rating.

#### Web Search Result Block

**What to Rate:** A click is required, and you should evaluate the landing page to assign a rating.

#### Device Action Result Block

**What to Rate:** Base your rating on the helpfulness of the action itself.

---

For example, think about the query <span class="query">what does love mean</span>.

<div class="examples">
<div class="example">

**Special Content Result Block**

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

![what does love mean Special Content Result Block](../images/img266.jpg)

Most users would probably not click on the Special Content Result Block, because the block contains a large amount of helpful content and has no obvious landing page link associated with it. Therefore, base your rating on the content inside the block itself.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="example">

**Web Search Result Block**

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

![what does love mean Web Search Result Block](../images/img267.jpg)

In this case, users would have to click on the web search result in order to get an answer to the question. Therefore, base your rating on the content of the landing page.

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

Here are some examples of Special Content Result Blocks where the block should be rated primarily on the content inside the block itself. As always, please use your judgment.

<div class="examples">
<div class="example">

**Query:** <span class="query">utopia animal hospital</span>

<div class="results">

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

## Fully Meets (FullyM)

**Fully Meets** is a special rating category, which can be used in the following situations:

- The query and user need must be specific, clear, and unambiguous.
- The result must be fully satisfying for mobile users, requiring minimal effort for users to immediately get or use what they are looking for.
- All or almost all users would be completely satisfied by the result—users issuing that query would not need additional results to fully satisfy the user intent.

In other words, the **Fully Meets** rating should be reserved for results that are the "complete and perfect response or answer" so that no other results are necessary for all or almost all users to be fully satisfied.

You will need to use your judgment to decide whether a result block can **Fully Meet** the user need. Here are some scenarios when the **Fully Meets** rating is appropriate:

- The user is clearly looking for a specific webpage or website and the result block with the specific webpage or website **Fully Meets** the user's need.
- The user is trying to complete a device action and the result block accomplishes the desired request.
- The user is looking for a very specific fact or piece of information and the result block provides the information immediately, thoroughly, accurately, and clearly. No other results would be needed. Before using the **Fully Meets** rating for queries seeking a very specific fact or piece of information, you must check for accuracy and confirm that the information is supported by expert consensus where such consensus exists.

**Fully Meets** may apply in other situations as well. Ask yourself whether the result block alone is the perfect and complete result that would fully satisfy all or almost all users. Be conservative when using the **Fully Meets** rating. When in doubt, consider a lower rating.

<div class="note">

Note: If a result block is very close to being fully satisfying, but the block alone may not be sufficient in order to fully satisfy all or almost all users, a rating of **Highly Meets+** may be appropriate.*

</div>

Sometimes you have to think about how specific the user need is and will need to make a judgment call on whether it is specific enough to possibly have a **Fully Meets** rating.

### Examples of Queries that Cannot Have Fully Meets Results

There are some queries that *cannot* have a **Fully Meets** result. Here are some examples.

- **Broad queries where no single result could fully satisfy all users**  
  - Example: <span class="query">knitting</span>  
    This is a broad informational query. Knitting is an activity anyone can do and that anyone can create a website for. Different users may want different types of content: videos, instructions, patterns, etc. There is no one official source for knitting information and no one result could satisfy most users. Therefore, no Fully Meets result is possible for this query.
  - Famous names. Example: <span class="query">barack obama</span>  
    This is a broad informational query and it is impossible to know exactly what the user is looking for.
- **Ambiguous queries without a clear user intent or dominant interpretation**  
  - Example: <span class="query">ada</span>

This is a result to download one of the YouTube apps. Mobile users want answers and results right away and may not be able to spend a lot of time downloading and installing apps. It is possible that users want one of the YouTube apps, but it is probably not the dominant intent for mobile users on the go.

## Slightly Meets (SM)

A rating of **Slightly Meets** is assigned to results that are helpful and satisfying for some or few users. **Slightly Meets** results may serve a minor interpretation, be low quality, have stale or outdated information, have some minor inaccuracies, be too specific, too broad, too niche for the general user population considering the query, etc. to receive a higher rating.

**Important note:** On mobile phones, the "cost of a click" is high. Many users decide which result to click or tap on based on the title of the web result on the search results page. (Note that these titles usually come from webpages.) A result with a very misleading or exaggerated title should be rated **Slightly Meets** or lower, due to the poor user experience that occurs when the landing page does not match the expectation of the user when clicking or tapping on the result.

### Examples of Slightly Meets (SM) Result Blocks

<div class="examples">
<div class="example">

**Query:** <span class="query">britney spears</span>  
**User Location:** Baltimore, Maryland  
**User Intent:** Find information about Britney Spears (e.g., current news, pictures).

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

![slightly meets example](../images/img445.jpg)

![slightly meets](../images/sm.jpg)

The LP of this mobile-friendly web result has a 2006 article about Britney Spears filing for divorce. This is very old, stale news, making the result helpful for few users.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="example">

**Query:** <span class="query">honda odyssey</span>  
**User Location:** Miami, Florida  
**User Intent:** We will assume that users are interested in the current Honda Odyssey model, unless specified otherwise.

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

![slightly meets example](../images/img447.jpg)

![slightly meets](../images/sm.jpg)

Although the LP has comprehensive information from a reputable source, and is easy to use on a mobile device, the information is about the 2010 Honda Odyssey. This information would be considered stale for the query today, making this result helpful for some or few users.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="example">

**Query:** <span class="query">hot dog</span>  
**User Location:** Sunnyvale, California  
**User Intent:** Find information about hot dogs, such as recipes or nutrition information

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

![slightly meets example](../images/img449.jpg)

![slightly meets](../images/sm.jpg)

The LP of this web result is about the movie "Hot Dog," which came out in 1984 and is a minor interpretation of this query. Because this is an unlikely interpretation, this web result would be helpful for few users, even though the landing page has good content from a reputable source, and is easy to use on a mobile device.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="example">

**Query:** <span class="query">motorcycles</span>

![slightly meets](../images/failsm+narrow.jpg)

This result provides contact information for one of the two motorcycle shops in Potsdam, New York. It is possible this would be helpful for some users, but many users would be looking for information. Additionally, there is distracting information (a listing for an insurance agent).

![slightly meets example](../images/img454.jpg)

![slightly meets](../images/sm-narrow.jpg)

This is a Wikipedia page that has birthdays for all U.S. presidents, including Abraham Lincoln. However, his birthday is not prominently displayed and it is not obvious that the answer is there—users have to do some work and search around on the page to find the answer, making SM to SM+ an appropriate rating.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="example">

**Query:** <span class="query">lack of sex and problems with my marriage</span>

**User Intent:** Find help for marital issues.

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

![slightly meets example](../images/img456.jpg)

![slightly meets](../images/sm.jpg)

The quality of writing in this article, which was created by a person without expertise in marriage or relationship counseling, is poor. Even though the article is about the query, the page is low quality and untrustworthy. It would be helpful for few users.

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

![slightly meets example](../images/img460.jpg)

This result block does not contain enough information to be fully satisfying and mentions only one type of shark. Most users would need to do further research.

<div class="example">

**Query:** <span class="query">210 area code</span>

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

![slightly meets example](../images/img462.jpg)

![slightly meets](../images/sm.jpg)

The answer in this result block is really confusing. Even if users can figure it out, they would likely still have to click on the link, or go to another website, to confirm the information.  

While there is a map, you would have to expand or click on it to see the details, so it is not that helpful.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="example">

**Query:** <span class="query">ibm</span>  
**User Location:** Rockville, Maryland  
**User Intent:** Go to the IBM website or find information about the company.

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

</div>
</div>
<div class="example">

**Query:** <span class="query">where is nibiru</span>  
**User Location:** Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  
**User Intent:** Find the location of "Nibiru", which was a fictional planet in the movie _Star Trek Into Darkness_, as well as a pseudoscientific outer planet in the solar system that doesn't actually exist.

<div class="results">
<div class="result">

![slightly meets example](../images/img467.jpg)

![slightly meets](../images/failsm+narrow.jpg)

The title of this article makes it appear as though the article describes an impending catastrophe. Yet, the MC states in its third paragraph that Nibiru "doesn't actually exist" and calls believers in it "conspiracy theorists". The title contradicts the content of the article, and as a result could mislead users who don't read the full article.

<div class="note">

Note: The "cost of a click" is high on mobile phones. Results with very misleading or exaggerated titles should be rated Slightly Meets or lower.

## Fails to Meet (FailsM)

A rating of **Fails to Meet** should be assigned to results that are helpful and satisfying for no or very few users. **Fails to Meet** results are unrelated to the query, factually incorrect (please check for factual accuracy of answers), and/or all or almost all users would want to see additional results. These results completely fail to meet the user intent, such as a lack of attention to an aspect of the query (or user location) that is important for satisfying user intent. **Fails to Meet** may also be used for results that are extremely low quality, have very stale or outdated information, be nearly impossible to use on a mobile device, etc.

**Fails to Meet** should be used for the following types of **Lowest Page Quality** results:

- Results that harm users (e.g., malicious download pages, "phishing" pages or websites, etc.).
- Pages or websites that misrepresent the website's owner or purpose, such as by impersonating a different site
(e.g., copied logo or branding of an unaffiliated site, URL that mimics another site's name).
- Pages or websites that appear to be deliberate attempts to misinform or deceive users by presenting factually inaccurate content (e.g., fake product reviews, demonstrably inaccurate news, etc.).
- Pages or websites with factually inaccurate content that can cause harm to users, regardless of their purpose or intent (e.g., inaccurate medical information; inaccurate information about how to vote, obtain a visa or green card, pay government taxes, etc.).

The following should also be rated **Fails to Meet** because they lead to very poor and upsetting user experiences:

- Porn results for non-porn-seeking queries.
- Upsetting or offensive results for queries that are not obviously seeking upsetting or offensive content.
- Pages that directly contradict well-established scientific or medical consensus for queries seeking scientific or medical information, unless the query indicates the user is seeking an alternative viewpoint.
- Pages that directly contradict well-established historical facts (e.g., unsubstantiated conspiracy theories), unless the query clearly indicates the user is seeking an alternative viewpoint.

WRAL is a television news station in North Carolina. Users want to go to the website or find information about the station. In this example, clicking on the blocks show information about the businesses' corporate headquarters. Note that television stations (like radio stations, newspapers, etc.) usually have special contact information for the public that is different than their corporate headquarter information. Also, with the query just being the name of the station, it is very unlikely that users want this kind of information.

<div class="note">

Remember: Just because a website has the look and feel of a traditional news site does NOT mean that you should consider the reporting to be factually accurate without further research.
